### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-transcript-generator.git
cd youtube-transcript-generator
2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on macOS/Linux

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

env
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
You can get your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio or the Google Cloud Console.

Note: This project uses the Whisper model to transcribe YouTube audio into text. Make sure your system has ffmpeg installed, as Whisper requires it to process audio files.

Install ffmpeg:

Windows: Download here

macOS: brew install ffmpeg

Linux (Debian): sudo apt install ffmpeg

🧠 How It Works
You provide a YouTube URL.

The app opens the video in the browser.

It uses Whisper to extract the transcript from the audio.

LangChain agent sends the transcript to Gemini for summarization.

The final summary is shown in your terminal.

▶️ Run the Agent
bash
Copy code
python agent.py
You'll be prompted to enter a YouTube video URL. The system will handle the rest.
